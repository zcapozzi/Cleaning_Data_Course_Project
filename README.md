I created a single script to execute all 5 steps of the data cleansing exercise.  Each subsequent section, beyond data loading, is tagged with the description given by the course assignment directions.

The steps are performed sequentially, resulting in the final tidy data frame and the measurements only data frame requested by the instructions.

In my original code, I used a setwd, but for the purposes of this submission, I've commented it out.
